I am Brayan, a PhD student at the University of Alicante (Spain) working in **Robotic Grasping and Machine Learning**. My research mainly focuses in finding ways to compute grasping points using **visual perception** as well as checking properties of the grasp using **tactile perception**. I would like to provide robots with the ability to tackle tasks which are natural for humans like grasping novel objects in the wild, predicting the outcome of a grasp or stabilising a grasped object using multiple robotic fingers.

I am passionate about learning new things and I am continuously looking for challenges. During my free time **I love reading books, listening and playing music, and also walking my dog**.
